## Detailed Component Explanations

### AXI-Lite Agent
The AXI-Lite agent is responsible for generating and monitoring AXI-Lite transactions. It consists of:
- **Driver**: Converts sequence items into pin-level activity on the AXI-Lite interface.
- **Monitor**: Observes AXI-Lite interface and creates transaction objects.
- **Sequencer**: Generates and controls the flow of sequence items to the driver.

### I2C Agent
The I2C agent simulates I2C bus activity and monitors the DUT's I2C operations. It includes:
- **Monitor**: Observes I2C bus activity and creates transaction objects.
- **Responder**: Emulates an I2C slave device, responding to the DUT's I2C transactions.

### Scoreboard
The scoreboard is crucial for verifying the correctness of the DUT's operations. It:
- Receives AXI-Lite transactions from the AXI-Lite monitor.
- Receives I2C transactions from the I2C monitor.
- Compares expected behavior (based on AXI-Lite commands) with actual I2C transactions.
- Reports any mismatches or unexpected behaviors.

### Coverage Collector
The coverage collector gathers functional coverage information to ensure thorough testing. It:
- Monitors AXI-Lite transactions.
- Tracks coverage of various DUT features, configurations, and corner cases.
- Provides coverage reports to guide the verification process.

## Test Execution Flow

1. The top-level testbench (`axil_tb_top`) initializes the simulation environment.
2. UVM phases are executed, starting with the build phase to construct the environment hierarchy.
3. The configured test class (e.g., `i2c_master_test`) is run, which sets up the initial DUT configuration.
4. Test sequences are executed, driving AXI-Lite transactions to the DUT.
5. The DUT processes these commands and generates I2C transactions.
6. Both AXI-Lite and I2C activities are monitored and sent to the scoreboard and coverage collector.
7. The scoreboard continuously checks for correct operation.
8. Coverage is collected throughout the test execution.
9. At the end of the test, results and coverage reports are generated.

## Conclusion

This verification environment provides a comprehensive setup for testing the AXI-Lite to I2C Master Bridge. By utilizing UVM methodology and advanced verification techniques, it ensures thorough testing of the DUT's functionality, performance, and compliance with protocol specifications.

### 8. Improve Documentation and Usability
TODO: Enhance documentation and add features to improve usability.
Actionable Steps:
- Add detailed comments to all classes and methods.
- Create a user guide with instructions on how to run tests and interpret results.
